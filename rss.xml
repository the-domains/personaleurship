            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>E643: Vicarious' Scott Phoenix on AI & the race to unlock the human brain to create AGI by TWiStartups</h1><p>True artificial intelligence is arguably the ultimate technology. To create machines that not only learn, but teach themselves, is sure to unlock new realms of technological possibilities that we haven't even considered. This is exactly what Vicarious aims to accomplish, and exactly why distinguished investors such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerburg, and Peter Thiel are pouring funding into this revolutionary company.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/502f7fbc32a727c15e4d030cd72071166a818ef6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 1 - The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</h1><p>Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down—all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/908af409-c74d-4921-821b-f8e26420868e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 2 - The AI Revolution: Our Immortality or Extinction</h1><p>Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we’ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is part of evolution—maybe the way evolution works is that intelligence creeps up more and more until it hits the level where it’s capable of creating machine superintelligence, and that level is like a tripwire that triggers a worldwide game-changing explosion that determines a new future for all living things</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b7054d2-1063-4edc-b319-196cd7332504.jpg"></article>]]></description>
