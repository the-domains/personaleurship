            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 1 - The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</h1><p>Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down—all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/908af409-c74d-4921-821b-f8e26420868e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 2 - The AI Revolution: Our Immortality or Extinction</h1><p>Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we’ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is part of evolution—maybe the way evolution works is that intelligence creeps up more and more until it hits the level where it’s capable of creating machine superintelligence, and that level is like a tripwire that triggers a worldwide game-changing explosion that determines a new future for all living things</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b7054d2-1063-4edc-b319-196cd7332504.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The First Step to Success? Admit Failure</h1><p>When former Medtronic CEO, Bill George, interviewed leadership candidates, he was interested in learning about both their failures and successes. After all, everyone has made mistakes on the job. But in George's mind, the best leaders are humble enough to recognize that they messed up, learn what not to do in the future, and develop resilience.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a6940e120b2c1285226e5b9220a6361270ea0e81.jpg"></article>]]></description>
