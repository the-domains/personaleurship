      Influential people have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. Yet,
      they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on
      themselves. We see only their outside. We see them innovate, speak their
      mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things. And,
      yet, we're missing the best part.

  Surely by now you've heard: Highly emotionally intelligent people are more
  successful, and companies are bending over backward to recruit them. The term
  "emotional intelligence" (often abbreviated to EQ or EI) was first coined by
  the psychologist and former New York Times journalist Daniel Goleman in 1995,
  and while it's had its critics, the term's buzzword status hasn't relented
  much since.
